## World_Weather_Analysis

### Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to improve the PlanMyTrip app by adding weather descriptions along with our weather data. Customers will be able to use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which can be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. 

### Weather Database
This map displays the information collected in the weather database and uses Google Maps API to plot different travel destinations with a hotel at each location. For example, the image below shows the locations of all the places in the database that have a daily maximum temperature ranging between 70F and 90F.

### Vacation Search
This map takes the information gained in the weather database and uses Google Maps API to plot different travel destinations with a hotel at each location. I chose four cities in Portugal for my vacation itinerary.

### Vacation Itinerary
This map goes a bit further by taking the information from the search folder and uses directions API to create a vacation itinerary. Popup markers were added with specific information for each of the four chosen cities that comprise the itinerary.
